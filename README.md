####### HOW TO #######
######################

You have the Deformer in the PushDeformer.py

In the SceneExample Folder, you will find two files:

    - .ma file with a scene example (deformerTestScene)
    - A python file (refresh_apply), which include a little script to 
      create a new scene and apply the deformer into a Torus

Thanks!
